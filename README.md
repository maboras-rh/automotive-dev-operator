# CentOS Automotive Suite Operator

An operator for building automotive OS images on OpenShift. This operator provides a cloud-native way to create automotive OS images using the automotive-image-builder (AIB) project, with support for both traditional AIB manifests and modern bootc container builds.

## Description

The CentOS Automotive Suite Operator enables automotive OS image building through:

- **ImageBuild Custom Resource**: Declaratively define and trigger automotive OS image builds
- **Multiple Build Modes**: Support for traditional AIB manifests and bootc container builds
- **CLI Tool (caib)**: Command-line interface for creating and monitoring builds
- **Artifact Management**: Serve built images via OpenShift Routes or push to OCI registries
- **Tekton Integration**: Uses OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton) for scalable build execution

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**For OpenShift Installation (Recommended):**
- OpenShift 4.17+ cluster
- OpenShift Pipelines Operator (Tekton) installed
- Cluster admin permissions (for initial installation)

**For Development:**
- Go 1.22.0+
- Podman or Docker
- OpenShift CLI (`oc`) or kubectl
- Operator SDK v1.42.0+ (for development)

## Installation

### Option 1: OpenShift OperatorHub (Recommended)

The easiest way to install on OpenShift is through OperatorHub:

1. Open the OpenShift Console
2. Navigate to **Operators** > **OperatorHub**
3. Search for "CentOS Automotive Suite"
4. Click **Install** and follow the prompts

After installation, create an `OperatorConfig` to enable components:

```sh
oc apply -f config/samples/automotive_v1_operatorconfig.yaml
```

### Option 2: OLM Bundle (Local Testing)

For local development and testing:

```sh
# Deploy catalog and install operator
./hack/deploy-catalog.sh --uninstall --install

# Create OperatorConfig to configure the operator
oc apply -f config/samples/automotive_v1_operatorconfig.yaml
```

### Option 3: Manual Deployment

**Build and push your image:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<registry>/automotive-dev-operator:tag
```

**Install CRDs and deploy the operator:**

```sh
make install
make deploy IMG=<registry>/automotive-dev-operator:tag
```

**Configure the operator:**

```sh
oc apply -f config/samples/automotive_v1_operatorconfig.yaml
```

## Usage

### Creating Your First Build

1. **Create an ImageBuild resource with an inline AIB manifest:**

```yaml
apiVersion: automotive.sdv.cloud.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: ImageBuild
metadata:
  name: my-automotive-image
spec:
  architecture: amd64
  aib:
    distro: autosd
    target: qemu
    mode: image
    manifest: |
      name: container

      content:
        rpms:
          - openssh-server
        systemd:
          enabled_services:
            - sshd.service
        add_files:
           - path: /usr/share/hello.txt
             text: |
               hello!
      image:
        image_size: 8 GiB

      auth:
        # "password"
        root_password: $6$xoLqEUz0cGGJRx01$H3H/bFm0myJPULNMtbSsOFd/2BnHqHkMD92Sfxd.EKM9hXTWSmELG8cf205l6dktomuTcgKGGtGDgtvHVXSWU.
        sshd_config:
          PermitRootLogin: true
          PasswordAuthentication: true
    manifestFileName: "simple.aib.yml"
  export:
    format: qcow2
    compression: gzip
```

2. **Apply the resource:**

```sh
oc apply -f imagebuild.yaml
```

3. **Monitor the build:**

```sh
oc get imagebuild my-automotive-image -w
oc logs -f job/my-automotive-image-build
```

## Uninstallation

### For OperatorHub Installation

1. In OpenShift Console, go to **Operators** > **Installed Operators**
2. Find "CentOS Automotive Suite" and click the options menu
3. Select **Uninstall Operator**

### For OLM Bundle Installation

```sh
./hack/deploy-catalog.sh --uninstall
```

### For Manual Deployment

```sh
# Delete operator resources
oc delete -k config/samples/
make undeploy

# Remove CRDs
make uninstall
```

## Components

### Custom Resources

- **ImageBuild**: Defines an automotive OS image build job
- **Image**: Represents a built image with metadata and location information
- **OperatorConfig**: Cluster-wide configuration for the operator

### Optional Components

When `OperatorConfig.spec.osBuilds.enabled` is true:
- **Build API**: REST API for programmatic access

### CLI Tool

The `caib` CLI provides command-line access to build operations. See [`cmd/caib/README.md`](cmd/caib/README.md) for usage details.

## Architecture

This operator is built with the Kubebuilder framework and uses:

- **Controller Runtime**: Manages Custom Resources and reconciliation loops
- **OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton)**: Executes build workflows as TaskRuns
- **Automotive Image Builder**: External tool for creating automotive OS images
- **OpenShift Routes**: Exposes build API and artifact serving endpoints

### Dependencies

- **OpenShift Pipelines Operator**: Required for Tekton pipeline execution
- **OpenShift 4.17+**: Minimum supported OpenShift version
- **Container Registry**: For storing built images (internal or external)

## Development

### Local Development

1. **Clone and setup:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/centos-automotive-suite/automotive-dev-operator.git
cd automotive-dev-operator
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```sh
make install
```

3. **Run locally:**

```sh
make run
```

### Testing
